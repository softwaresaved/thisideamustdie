These notes summarise the discussion session held at the Collaborations Workshop 2015, Oxford on March 26, 2015.

**Discussion Topic:  Which commonly held ideas in research software are impeding progress and need to be retired?**

_Chair: Mike Croucher_

_Reporter: Dominic Orchard_

### Background 

This session was inspired by the Freakonomics podcast [This Idea Must Die] (http://freakonomics.com/2015/03/05/this-idea-must-die-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/) [\[transcript\]](http://freakonomics.com/2015/03/05/this-idea-must-die-full-transcript/)

### Ideas everyone agreed on

We should retire... 

1.  ... the idea that published papers are the fundamental output mode for research
   * publish data/code instead, and see how it is used

2. ... the prevailing viewpoint of people being "*just* a developer"
   * Providing a service but actually a participant 
      * _"It is our privilege to serve, but we are not servants"_
      * _"Just because we work here doesn't mean we are like you"_
   * Should be more of a collaboration, two-way communication
   * The word 'service' is descriptive but '*just* a service' is perjorative.
   * The service is not passive 
   * Suggest new directions/questions. 

3. ... fixed job titles (which constrain people's abilities)
   * Instead, a number of roles [even if not 100% research]
    
4. ... the idea that non-pure researchers are less valuable [purists are valued more]
   * We should appreciate all roles/contributions
      * Sometimes elitism is on both sides of the fence - cf. the software expert

5. ... the idea that software has to perfect before it is released [that the same standards of robustness have to be applied to all software]
   * Doing _something_ is useful
   * Still good to strive for quality (e.g., testing)
   * We should encourage/build up when people do this, not tear them apart 
   * Teaching/training to help people document their code, including providing issue lists.

6. ... the idea that you can think about long-term sustainability at the end of the project (and not from the beginning)
   * In the last couple of weeks you can upload code and that will ensure the project keeps going
      * [at least better than not putting it up.]
      * Is there funding support for this? What if a tool is no longer supported/funded?
      * The fear that what happens if a core library is no longer supported.
      * build a *sustainable ecosystem* around the software [e.g., plug and play libraries, APIs]
      * migration at some point may be needed- but if the ecosystem is sustainable then it doesn't mean the death of the project.

7. ... the idea that all software has a right to live for ever and that maintaining existing work is free
   * [specifically including software which still has users]
   * Software should have an 'end of life plan'. [unsustainable software]

8. ... the idea that if you started a project it is your responsibility to sustain it. 
   * [Publish code under a psuedonym!] 

9. ... the idea that we can avoid bugs by just being really careful [bug free software is possible]
   * [includes: testing is not necessary]
   * "if we understand the physical model then the code will be right"
      
10. ... all known bugs need to be fixed
   * "must have bug free software to do research"
   * [prioritise effort]
      * not always essential
      * some known bugs are ok: fixing bugs can generate whole new paths of possible bugs
         * (i.e., fixing bugs can be risky if new bugs emerge). 
         * Known stable situations with bugs sometimes better 

11. ... all vocal users must be pacified.

12. ... systems should always be backwards compatible (ad infinitum).


### Controversial ideas

Not all members of the session agreed that these ideas should die.

13. ... that all closed software must be avoided.
    * [it is not necessarily evil]
    * Commercial software often more sustainable/longer life
      * But sometimes software is dropped or licenses/academic discounts drop
      * What about people with less research money?
    * Difference between free closed (e.g., Visual C++) and paid closed
    * A trade off- might be short on time but worth the effort to avoide paid/closed software.
      * Research, non-commercial uses of products should be free
      * or licenses should have sliding scale depending on who wants it (developing world, small commercial)
